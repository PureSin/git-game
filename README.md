# git-game: The committer guessing game

## What is it?

In the git game, you  guess who made a commit to your team's repo based on their commit message.

The goal is to get the longest streak! (It's harder than you think...)

## How do I play?

- Download the `git-game` executable
- Put it somewhere on your PATH
- Then, in any git repository, run `git game`

## Requirements

- Requires Ruby >1.8

## "I can't get it to work", "It would be cool if you could...", blah blah

Patches welcome!
